     Allows you to return the size as a CGSize for each card at their specified index.
     This function will be called for every card. You can customize each card to have a different size.

     Because this function uses the standard `sizeForItem` function of a `UICollectionView` internally,
     you should keep in mind that returning a very small cell size results in multiple columns (like a standard collectionview),
     which is not supported at the moment and very buggy.

     This function will also take the custom insets into account, in case (itemSize - insets) is negative,
     it will not take the insets into account.
     - parameter verticalCardSwiperView: The `VerticalCardSwiperView` that will display the `CardCell`.
     - parameter index: The index for which we return the specific CGSize.
     - returns: The size of each card for its respective index as a CGSize.
